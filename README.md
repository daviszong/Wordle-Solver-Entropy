_A blazing-fast, information-theoretic Wordle AI_

Wordle-Solver-Entropy is a high-performance C++ solver that uses information theory to crack the popular NYT Wordle game with near-optimal efficiency. It strategically selects guesses to maximize entropy (information gain), narrowing the possible solutions as fast as possible.

## üß† How It Works

At a high level, the solver cycles through this loop:
1. Filter remaining words by matching past feedback
2. Evaluate each possible guess:
      ‚Üí Simulate its feedback patterns for all possible solutions
      ‚Üí Calculate the expected information gain (entropy)
3. Pick the guess with the highest entropy
4. Repeat until solved

## **‚ö° Performance Features**
- Entropy-based guess selection: Always picks the guess that, on average, will reduce the most uncertainty.
- Monte Carlo fallback: When >1500 candidates remain, uses a random sample for faster entropy estimation.
- Precomputed feedback table: All pairwise Wordle feedback patterns are computed once and stored.
- Multithreaded testing: Uses all available CPU cores to batch-test performance.
- First-guess override: Always starts with "slate" (configurable).

## **üìä Benchmark Results**
Original NYT word list (2,315 words, short_words.txt):

- Average guesses: 3.4903 (within ~2% of the theoretical minimum 3.4212)
- Time to solve all words: ~0.3s
- Win rate: 100% (‚â§6 guesses)

## **Extended list (14,855 words, words.txt):**
- Average guesses: 4.24
- Time to solve all words: 27.1s
- Win rate: 98.9%
- Common failure cases: rare/duplicate heavy words like waqfs, vives

_üí° Real-world optimization potential: weighting guesses by real-world word and letter frequency could improve performance against human-curated word sets._

## **üñ•Ô∏è Installation & Usage**

Note: If you're using the solver to play wordle nowadays, be sure to provide the extended words list "words.txt" to the solver in the line G_words = load_words("words.txt") so that it encompasses all the possible solutions of the extended word bank. Also, be sure to use interactive mode (option 1 when the console prompts you), and enter the result string as five digits, 0 for gray, 1 for yellow, 2 for green. (e.g. 00122 for 2 grays, one yellow, and 2 greens.).

## **üéÆ What is Wordle?**

Wordle is a 5-letter word guessing game.
After each guess, tiles show:

üü© Green: correct letter & position
üü® Yellow: correct letter, wrong position
‚¨ú Gray: letter not in the word
